Reworked the weapon placing when holding it in the 3 stages ( Shot W/O aiming | Aiming W/O Zoom | Aiming With Zoom ) 

All these 3 stages have been modified in some weapons like: Assault Rifle | Carbine Rifle (MK2 too) | Pistol | Combat Pistol | Heavy Pistol | For Example.

I've made some quality of life changes on the previous release, and now there is a lot more weapons included, hope you like it!
